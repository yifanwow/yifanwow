Hello! Iâ€™m Yifan Yu, a graduate student at the intersection of magic and logicâ€”where software meets hardware at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) / [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/).  
Iâ€™m working toward blending code with circuit boards to create cool, tech-savvy gadgets.  

When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in code, you can find me crafting full-stack apps with Python and C# up front and JavaScript, Node.js, and Express at the back, all floating on the cloud with AWS. Itâ€™s a bit like being a digital chef, mixing ingredients that perfectly blend into innovative solutions.

Iâ€™m also fascinated by the highways of data transmission and the fortresses of network security, ensuring information flows safely and swiftly. And when itâ€™s time to unwind? Iâ€™m plotting strategies over board games. Itâ€™s all about having a blast while honing those problem-solving skills.

Drop by my world where creativity meets technology, and letâ€™s build something beautiful together!
