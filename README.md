Hello! Iâ€™m Yifan Yu, a recent graduate from Cornell University and Cornell Tech, where I explored the fascinating intersection of software and hardware.   
In my personal projects, I focus on building full-stack applications using C#, complemented by JavaScript, most hosted on AWS.  
  
For me, the process of creating software, much like painting for artists or composing for musicians, is profoundly important.   
The passion derived from transforming an idea into reality is irreplaceable and is what I cherish the most.   
  
My dream is bringing the beauty of technology into everyday life.  
Welcome to my world where creativity meets technology, and letâ€™s build something beautiful together!
